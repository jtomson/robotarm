A python package for controlling a Lynxmotion Robot Arm with Python
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a research / exploration project for work that was mothballed in 2009.
I had posted some videos on youtube and recently had a couple of requests for
the code, so I decided to put it up.

The code was pretty jumbled up, so I've tried to clean it up as best I can. If
you'd like to check out the original import you can see it at commit 3a87508.
I've tried to add comments and docstrings to show what I'm doing, but as it is
attempting to accomplish a complex task the methodology may not be clear. If
you have any questions, please contact me and I'll try to help you out. If
there's sufficient interest, I'll get some better documentation as well.

Anyways, here it is. Let me know if you use it, like it or need help with a
similiar project.
